			<p>As the vice president of the game design club at the University of Connecticut, I showed my passion, dedication, drive, and skill in game design. I displayed my leadership skills by mentoring newcomers to the field of game design. By managing the club, I was responsible for identifying and scheduling guest speakers, and teaching what I’ve learned. As a result, I was labeled as the “go-to” person in video game and media design at UConn.</p>

			<p><a>2022</a></p>
			<p>Gatekeeper is an interactive Virtual Reality play I worked on with two professors at the University of Connecticut. I was the lead level designer, coder, and 3d artist. I set up Virtual Reality in the Unity engine, coded in C#, modeled the whole scene in 3DS Max, textured in Adobe Substance 3D painter, and shared project files over Github. In addition, I was able to use Unity plugins (Post Processing and Cinemachine) for polish and movement.</p>
