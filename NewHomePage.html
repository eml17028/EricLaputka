 			<h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
 			<p>Hey, I'm Eric Laputka. I'm a game designer who recently graduated from the University of Connecticut. I am skilled in working in virtual reality, scripting, lighting, modeling, design, and leadership. I recently won an award for excellence in my most recent game, Pizza Time. I was the vice president of the game design club which allowed me to help and show others the joy of making games. I am a game designer at Pyrebug Studios and create games that provide enjoyable experiences for gamers of all ages. In addition, I have participated in 3 Game jams! Just check my portfolio and youll see what I mean!</p>

				<p>Pizza Time was my senior project for the University of Connecticut BFA program. It won an award for excellence at the BFA showcase during April of 2022. Pizza Time is a 3d platformer heavily influenced by the 3d platformers during the Nintendo 64 era, like Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, and Conker's bad fur day. The plot of the game is that you are a slice of pizza that has to travel to the past in order to save his world from the corrupted pineapple pizza.

				<p>Beettalion is a virtual reality card game combined with a tower defense game. You face head to head attacking your opponent while also defending from his attacks. Honey is the currency for all your actions, like drawing and playing cards, so using your honey wisely is the key to victory. Do you build your base and save up strong attacking cards, or do you go on an all out attack in order to secure a quick and decisive victory? The choice is yours!

				<p>Gatekeeper is an interactive virtual reality play that I worked on with Kenneth Thompson and Vincent Tycer as an independent study. The play is based off the events of gamer gate and involves 360 video as well as a virtual world. My task was to work on one of the scenes where I modeled a cave and a bar, set up the lighting and timeline, and coded the events. It was a task that I didn’t have much to go off of, but I believe the product came out great!

				<p>The Wisdom of Water interactive map had me working as a team for the Eco Peace organization. The goal of this project is to spread awareness of the Jordan River water crisis by making an interactive map. We achieved this by recreating the river along with three unique site locations along the river in unity. The map has information along with a slider to show the water level depletion throughout time to show what humans have done and the two projected futures depending on if we help or not.

				<p>Castle adventure is a game I worked on with a fellow developer. We both wanted to try out the Roblox engine and create a simple platformer in it. You will embark on an adventure past treacherous terrain in order to reclaim your rightful place as ruler. Do you have what it takes to reclaim the throne?

				<p>Game pitch is a minigame inspired party game made in my advanced game design class. The main game is based around baseball and 2 players compete head to head on offence V.S. defence. The offensive player has to score as many points as possible in order to get the best possible hit (a homerun). The defence however is there to stop the offensive player by any means necessary!

												<h1><a href="games/jump/index.html">Jumping For Joy</a></h1>
				<p>Jumping for joy is a 2d platformer with an added mechanic. I built it in unity and scripted it in C#. The mechanic is being able to spawn in extra platforms to help you along the way. This is my favorite game that I have completed so far because it was the game where everything started to click. I had a lot more time on this project because it was my final for my intro to game scripting class, and had a ton of fun with it.

				<p>This color tool was a tool I made in Unity. It can be used in the editor and is based on the Adobe Color Picker. You are able to take a base color and the tool will be able to output color schemes such as monochromatic, complementary, split complementary, triad, etc… This was one of my assignments in my advanced scripting class and it is a good demonstration of my scripting and problem-solving abilities.

				<p>Scrapshoot is a real-time strategy game mixed with tower defense elements made by Pyrebug Studios. The game started as just a game jam game but later formed into a game released on steam. I am currently working on this by adding a single-player story mode where I expand on gameplay while reusing and expanding on existing assets and ideas.

	<h1><a href="https://joshmh7128.github.io/Plunderful-Voyage-Builds/">Plunderful Voyage: <br>Global Game Jam 2021</a></h1>
				<p>I did this game jam with the Pyrebug team and worked on some of the game design, and coding. We made this in 36hrs and this was my first game jam. The theme was lost & found with the main gameplay loop being similar to a crazy taxi. You go from location to location doing tasks with random world events going on as you sail the sea.

				<p>I did this game jam with the Pyrebug team and worked on some of the coding, ai, level/game design, and some modeling. We made this in 36hrs and fought with Unity the whole time. A lot of our team members could not work on the game or had limited access because Unity was acting up. Regardless we were able to make a top-down zombie shooter where you fight off zombies. The main gimmick was the weapons you used were decided on a die that would roll for a new gun whenever you ran out of ammo. There were 3 levels, get to the end, capture the flag, and race to the finish.

				<p>I did this game jam solo in 36hrs. I was able to code all the mechanics, model all the scenery and props, and design the level. The theme of this game jam was “Rooted” and I was able to make a physics-based golf game where the acorn can root itself into the ground to move the obstacles out of the way. The game is very janky, but I am proud of what I was able to accomplish by myself in such a small time frame.
