 			<h1>Introduction</h1>
 			<p>Hey, I'm Eric Laputka. I'm a game designer from the University of Connecticut. I am skilled in scripting, lighting, modeling, design, and leadership. I am currently working on a solo project of a 3d game where all my skills are being pushed. I am also currently the vice president of the game design club which allows me to help and show others the joy of making games. Along with that I am working as a game designer at pyrebug Studios where I am able to work with a team to create enjoyable experiences. In addition to that I’ve co created a game in roblox with over 200 plays with a 100% like ratio.</p>

 			<h1>Passions</h1>
 			<p>My main passion is in game design. I loved playing games growing up and still love playing games. This is where my passion started and only grew from there. I also have a passion for 3d modeling and 3d lighting and texturing. I enjoy doing it but would consider that more as a hobby. I still have much to learn in game design, but I am passionate to keep learning and growing as a game designer.

 			<h1>Goals</h1>
 			<p>My goals are to develop my skills as a game designer and eventually get a job in game design. However, I don’t just want to be good at game design, I want to be great, and want my talents to eventually be recognized. I have much to learn and it looks like I have a mountain to climb in order to reach this goal, but I know my hard work and determination will get me there.</p>
