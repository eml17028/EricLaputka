 			<h1>Introduction</h1>
 			<p>Hey, I'm Eric Laputka. I'm a game designer from the University of Connecticut. I am skilled in working in virtual reality, scripting, lighting, modeling, design, and leadership. I recently won an award for excellence in my most recent game, Pizza Time. I was the vice president of the game design club which allowed me to help and show others the joy of making games. I am a game designer at Pyrebug Studios and create games that provide enjoyable experiences for gamers of all ages. Just check my portfolio and youll see what I mean!</p>

 			<h1>Passions</h1>
 			<p>My passion is in game design. Ever since I was young, I loved playing and analyzing games. I still love it today.  My passion started at an early age and only grew from there. I also dig 3d modeling, lighting, and texturing. Even though I am well versed and have a college degree in the above, I enjoy learning new technologies that allows me to grow in the ever changing a game design industry.

 			<h1>Goals</h1>
 			<p>My goals are to continue to develop my skills as a game designer and change the game design industry. I donâ€™t just want to be good at game design, I want to be great! I want my talents to be recognized. I am always growing and have what seems to be a mountain to climb in to reach my goal, but I know my hard work and determination will get me there!</p>
