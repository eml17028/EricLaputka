				<h1><a href="https://github.uconn.edu/pages/eml17028/PizzaTime/PizzaTime/Pizza_Time!/Builds/MidtermCritBuild/index.html">Pizza Time</a></h1>
				<p>Pizza Time is a 3d platformer heavily influenced by the 3d platformers during the nintendo 64 era, like mario 64, banjo kazooie, and conker's bad fur day. The plot of the game is that you are a slice of pizza that has to travel to the past in order to save his world from the corrupted pineapple pizza. The game is my Senior project and is currently in Alpha.

				<h1><a href="games/jump/index.html">Jumping For Joy</a></h1>
				<p>Jumping for joy is a 2d platformer with an added mechanic. I built it in unity and scripted it in C#. The mechanic is being able to spawn in extra platforms to help you along the way. This is my favorite game that I have completed so far because it was the game where everything started to click. I had a lot more time on this project because it was my final for my intro to game scripting class, and had a ton of fun with it.

				<h1><a href="https://github.uconn.edu/pages/eml17028/DMD4500_GamePitch/GamePitch/Builds/index.html">Game Pitch</a></h1>
				<p>Game pitch is a minigame inspired party game made in my advanced game design class. The main game is based around baseball and 2 players compete head to head on offence V.S. defence. The offensive player has to score as many points as possible in order to get the best possible hit (a homerun). The defence however is there to stop the offensive player by any means necessary!

				<h1><a href="https://github.uconn.edu/pages/eml17028/DMD2500_Dream_Bean/DreamBeanFinal/index.html">Dream Bean</a></h1>
				<p>Dream bean is a 2d platformer where you run a coffee shop during the day, and whenever you go to sleep, you are in a nightmare and the goal is to make it to the bed and wake up. Each time that you fall asleep, the world around you seems to get darker. I made this game with 2 other students. We made this in construct for my Introduction to game design final. I enjoyed making this game, and really enjoyed working as a team on this game with other students.

				<h1><a href="games/roll/index.html">Roll A Ball</a></h1>
				<p>Roll a ball is a simple game where your goal is to roll a ball to the end of the stage, and collect as many green cubes as you can. This is the game that I made to get me introduced into scripting. The game is very barebones, but the movement is fun and addicting and would end up being used again in Pizza Time.

				<h1><a href="games/rpg/index.html">RPG Test</a></h1>
				<p>Test RPG is a game with a battle system close to the one in pokemon, and other turn based RPGs. I struggled heavily on making this game for my intro to scripting class, but learned a lot by making it. I am not as proud of the finished project as I am proud of the scripting knowledge that I gained by making this project.

				<h1><a href="games/space/index.html">Space Shooter</a></h1>
				<p>Space shooter is an endless 2d shooter where the goal is to get the highest score by destroying falling asteroids and aliens. This is the first game that I had learned to script without really using a tutorial. The game is enjoyable, but needs polish, and a little fixing. I plan on going back to this game in the near future to fix the game with the knowledge that I have picked up since first making the game.
